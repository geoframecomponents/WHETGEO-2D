# WHETGEO-2D
WHETGEO-2D (Water HEat Transport in GEOframe) is a Java-based modeling environment simulating water flow, heat and solute transport in variably saturated porous media.

The source code of external libraries contained in the `lib` folder can be found here:
- [Buffer](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/Buffer) contains the source code of the buffer componets. 
- [ClosureEquation](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/ClosureEquation) contains the source code of the parametrization describing the hydraulic and thermal properties of the soil.
- [GEOMesh](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/GEOMesh) contains the source code to handle the computational mesh.
- [NetCDF](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/NetCDF) contains the source code of the components to read and write netCDF files,
- [Numerical](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/Numerical) contains the source code the classes dealing with the algorithms to solve linear systems and to linearize nonlinear systems.


Hoping that WHETGEO will whet your interest.
